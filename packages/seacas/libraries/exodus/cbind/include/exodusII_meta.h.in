 * Meta information for libexodus which can be used by other packages
 *  which depend on libexodus.
 *
 * This file is automatically generated by the build system
 * at configure time, and contains information related to
 * how libexodus was built.  It will not be required to
 * include this file unless you want to probe the capabilities
 * of libexodus. This should ideally only happen when configuring
 * a project which depends on libexodus.  At configure time,
 * the dependant project can set its own macros which can be used
 * in conditionals.
