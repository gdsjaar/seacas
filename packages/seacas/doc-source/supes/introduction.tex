\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
The Software Utilities Package for the Engineering
Sciences (SUPES) is a collection of subprograms which perform frequently
used non-numerical services for the engineering applications programmer.
The
three functional categories of SUPES are: 

\begin{enumerate}

\item input command parsing,

\item dynamic memory management, and 

\item system dependent utilities.

\end{enumerate}

The subprograms in categories one and two are written in standard
FORTRAN-77~\cite{ansi}, while the subprograms in category three are
written in the C programming language.  Thus providing a standardized
FORTRAN interface to several system dependent features across a
variety of hardware configurations while using a single set of source
files.  This feature can be viewed as a maintenance aid from several
perspectives.  Among these are: there is only one set of source files
to account for, it allows one to standardize the build procedure, and
it provides a clearer starting point for any future ports.  In fact, a
build procedure is now part of the standard SUPES distribution and is
documented in Chapter~\ref{sec:install}.  Further, the system
dependent modules set an appropriate template for the porting of SUPES
to other hardware and/or software configurations.

Applications programmers face many similar user and system interface problems
during code development.  Because ANSI standard FORTRAN does not address many of
these problems, each programmer solves these problems for his/her own code.
SUPES aids the programmer by:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Providing a library of useful subprograms.

\item Defining a standard interface format for common utilities.

\item Providing a single point for debugging of common utilities.  That
is, SUPES has to be debugged only once and then is ready for use
by any code.
\end{enumerate}

Use of SUPES by the applications programmer can expand a code's capability,
reduce errors, minimize support effort and reduce development time.  Because
SUPES was designed to be reliable and supportable, there are some features
that are not included.
\begin{enumerate}

\item It is not extremely sophisticated, rather it is
reliable and maintainable.

\item Except for the extension library (Chapter~\ref{sec:extlib}), it is not system dependent.

\item It does not take advantage of extended
system capabilities since they may not be available on a wide range of
operating systems.

\item It is not written to maximize cpu speed.

\end{enumerate}
