\vspace{-.4cm}\par

The Software Utilities Package for the Engineering Sciences (SUPES) is a
collection of subprograms which perform frequently used non-numerical
services for the engineering applications programmer.  The three functional
categories of SUPES are: (1) input command parsing, (2) dynamic memory
management, and (3) system dependent utilities.  The subprograms in categories
one and two are written in standard FORTRAN-77, while the subprograms in
category three are written to provide a standardized FORTRAN interface to
several system dependent features.

NOTE: This version has been cleaned up a little to reflect the current state
of the code.  Some sections have been removed that are no longer relevant.
